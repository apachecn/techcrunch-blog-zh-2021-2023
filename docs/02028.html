<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">踏板车由后部的 500W 连续和 750W 八方轮毂电机驱动，在美国最高时速可达 28 英里。欧洲更严格的电动自行车法规意味着这些版本将只有 250W 电机，最高时速为 15.5 英里。美国版本将同时具有油门和踏板辅助，而欧洲版本只有踏板辅助。BQi 还将与应用程序连接，并具有许多智能安全功能。它在美国的售价将为 1，499 美元，对于这样一辆功能强大的电动自行车来说，这是一笔非常划算的交易。</span></p>

CES 2022 上展示的 Okai SP10 智能背包</span> </span> </span> </span></amp-carousel></p>
<p class="translated"><b> Okai </b>，<span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">另一家为众多大牌共享运营商提供车辆的中国厂商，带着五款产品来到 CES，但三款中只有一款能骑。让我们从那里开始。EB20 电动自行车由专业级山地车部件制成，配有轻质碳纤维车架。这是一辆 12 速自行车，配有 750 瓦电机、可更换的三星电池和一个 2.8 英寸大的 LED 触摸屏。</span></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc"> Okai 还推出了其 ES600 共享电动滑板车，以满足不断增长的滑板车共享行业的需求。它具有可更换的电池系统，每个电池上都有内置手柄，优化的重量分布，低重心和液压悬挂系统。它还具有侧灯和前灯指示器、LED 前灯和尾灯以及侧装式反射器。ES800 是一款越野性能滑板车，配有一个严重的 1800W 电机，12 英寸越野轮胎，35%的斜坡爬升率和双减震器。这种重型车辆的重量比大多数电动滑板车重 30%，以提供更多的稳定性。</span></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">现在，谈谈你不能骑的产品。Okai 推出了由抗菌材料制成的 SH10 智能头盔，以实现更安全、更卫生的通勤。这些也可能是面向共享的观众，城市越来越多地要求包括头盔。</span></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">头盔集成了蓝牙，可以连接到 Okai 应用程序，骑行者可以从中定制和配置前后 LED 显示屏，以提高可见度。智能集成扬声器还允许驾驶者在路上听音乐而不影响听觉。</span></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">最后，Okai 带着它的 SP10 智能背包来到了拉斯维加斯，该背包具有紫外线消毒室、用于安全访问的指纹传感器、集成设备充电和可与车辆状态同步的可定制 RGB 条。</span></p>

<p class="translated"><b>博世</b></p>
<p class="translated"><span data-amp-original-style="font-weight: 400;" class="amp-wp-fe3f5cc">该系统由充当钥匙的 eBike Flow 应用程序、控制单元、显示器、充电电池和驱动单元组成。与 CES 上的其他产品一样，联网自行车可以通过无线方式更新，记录个人骑行信息和健身数据，定制骑行模式，并在主屏幕上显示电池充电状态和下次服务预约等信息。</span></p>

<p class="translated">最后，为了保持有趣，还有<strong>月球车</strong>。现在，再次，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221012134833/https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/">该公司的电动雪地车并不完全是新的</a>，但 CES 是人们第一次真正亲自检验它。这是一辆单轨雪地车，有一个 3 千瓦(4 马力)的电动机，最高时速可达 26 英里。</p>
<p class="translated">只有 182 磅重，比你的传统雪地车轻得多，这可能会使它更容易操纵和玩耍。它的设计是后部有一个雪地赛道，前面有一个单独的滑雪板，它的电池在运动模式下可以行驶大约 12 英里，在经济模式下可以行驶 22 英里。充满电需要大约五个小时。</p>
