<p class="translated">新眼镜展示了其第二代“Z-Lens 2D 波导”技术，将 AR 绽放所需的技术尺寸和重量减半。</p>
<p class="translated">“为了让 AR 眼镜以一种有意义的方式渗透到消费者市场，它们需要在功能和美学上都给人留下深刻的印象。Lumus 首席执行官 Ari Grobman 在接受 TechCrunch 采访时表示:“通过 Z-Lens，我们将外形和功能结合起来，消除了行业的进入壁垒，为消费者的广泛采用铺平了道路。“两年前，我们引进马克西姆斯·2D 反射式波导技术仅仅是一个开始。Z-Lens 及其所有改进开启了消费者热切期待的增强现实的未来。”</p>

<p class="translated">这些镜头包括 2Kx2K 分辨率，令人惊讶的鲜艳颜色和一个平视显示器，即使在大白天也可以看到。对于这位特殊的眼镜佩戴者来说，这是一个额外的好消息——该公司的技术可以直接绑定到 Rx 处方眼镜上。这项技术通过使用所谓的“反射波导”来帮助眼镜框中的微型投影仪投影到半透明镜片的内部。这意味着该眼镜可用作普通眼镜，同时也可用作投影面。另一个优点是漏光量极小——所以从正面几乎不可能看到佩戴者正在将信息传送到他们的眼孔中。</p>
<p class="translated">该公司告诉我，它已经开始了一场专利狂欢，声称它已经获得了 430 多项专利，还有 540 项专利正在申请中。这不仅使其成为世界上增强现实光学领域的顶级专利持有者，也使其成为一家大型公司的收购目标，这家公司可能害怕被起诉，厌倦支付许可费，或者两者兼而有之。</p>
