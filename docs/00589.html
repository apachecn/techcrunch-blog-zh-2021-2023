<p class="translated">Nuzzel 有一个小而忠诚的用户群，他们失望地看到 Twitter 在收购了 Nuzzel 的母公司 Scroll 之后关闭了他们最喜欢的服务。这项服务向用户展示你在 Twitter 上联系的人在阅读什么，以及在平台上分享什么，从而充当了 Twitter 推文缺失的监管层。与浏览 Twitter 的趋势相比，这是一种更个性化的方式来了解正在讨论的内容。</p>

<p class="translated">另一个新功能是能够阅读 Twitter 上分享的新闻文章，没有广告和杂乱。这项功能也是通过 Twitter 收购 Scroll 的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230311074327/https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">实现的，本质上与 Scroll 的工作方式相同。该公司与数百家出版商合作，为点击平台上链接的 Twitter Blue 订户提供快速加载、无广告的阅读体验。参与的著名公司包括《华盛顿邮报》、《BuzzFeed》和《BuzzFeed 新闻》、《滚石》、《综艺》、《最后期限》、《好莱坞报道》、《IndieWire》、《赫芬顿邮报》、《大西洋》、《内幕》、《今日美国》、《MacRumors》、《BGR》、《Slate》、《每日野兽》、《迈阿密先驱报》、《时尚播报》、《电视线》、《沙龙》、《琼斯母亲》、《萨克拉门托蜜蜂》、《费城问询者》、《SEJ》等。</a></p>
<p class="translated">当 Twitter Blue 成员点击这些网站的新闻链接时，出版商本身将向用户提供无广告的阅读体验——而不是 Twitter。目前，Twitter 表示，它有 300 个美国网站在 Twitter Blue 上运行，未来还会有“更多”网站上线。</p>

<p class="translated">快速加载、整齐有序的文章是其他科技巨头已经提供的功能，包括脸书的即时文章和谷歌的 AMP。但这些早期的努力一直有争议，因为<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230311074327/https://searchengineland.com/whether-google-manipulated-amp-or-not-its-a-great-time-to-reassess-using-it-375597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">将出版商锁定为</a>格式，这可能会决定他们在各自平台上的可见性。他们有时也会被<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230311074327/https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/are-facebook-instant-articles-worth-it.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">批评</a>没有兑现他们的承诺，比如增加货币化，以及向出版商提供有限的用户数据。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，Twitter 吹嘘其新闻阅读功能是订阅者支持他们喜爱的网站的一种方式，因为 Twitter 蓝色订阅的一部分将直接支付给参与的出版商。该应用程序将显示一个图表，显示哪些网站收到了基于你自己的读者群的付款，以及他们赚了多少钱。</p>
<p class="translated">Twitter 表示，该计划旨在让微支付带来比广告更多的收入。</p>
<p class="translated">“我们的目标是每个网站的人均收入比他们给那个人制作的服务广告多 50%，”Twitter 产品高级总监 Tony Haile 在介绍这项功能时说道。“在 Twitter，我们认识到一场伟大的公共对话需要一个繁荣的新闻生态系统。因此，通过 Blue，我们不仅仅是想为订户提供更好的互联网，也为新闻业提供更好的互联网，”他补充道。</p>
<p class="translated">但就取代潜在的货币化而言，这些微支付可能还不够，这种货币化来自于让读者直接访问一个网站，在那里他们不仅会遇到广告，还会遇到网站必须提供的其他促销和倡议——如订阅、免费和付费的时事通讯、活动门票或出版商可能希望提供给观众的任何其他东西。Twitter 蓝色读者也可能无法像网络访问者那样在网站上重复浏览，从而降低整体参与度。</p>

<p class="translated">Twitter 指出，在发布时，Twitter Blue 的一些功能会因市场和平台而异。</p>
<p class="translated">Top Articles 最初在 Android 和桌面上发布。应用图标和主题等个性化功能仅适用于 iOS，自定义导航和固定 DM 对话也是如此。显然，对从网络上传较长视频的支持仅限于桌面。</p>
<p class="translated">随着今天的发布，Twitter Blue 现已在美国、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰上市。该公司表示，计划在其他市场提供订阅服务，但目前无法对这些计划置评。</p>
