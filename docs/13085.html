				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Apple is clamping down on AirDrop privacy settings for all its users with the iOS 16.2 update, after backlash its recent restrictions were impacting the feature’s use in China. In November, reports circulated that Apple had begun<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214065726/https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/apple-limits-airdrop-everyone-option-to-10-minutes-in-china/"> limiting the use of AirDrop in China</a> as the country was facing widespread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214065726/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/world/asia/china-protests-covid-beijing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests</a> over the Chinese government’s “zero Covid” policy. Protesters had been using AirDrop, which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, to instantly share files with one other while avoiding Chinese censors.</p>
<p class="translated">By leaving “Everyone” enabled, protestors and others had been able to easily receive files from anyone else, including those who were not already in their iPhone Contacts.</p>
<p class="translated">Users first noticed new restrictions on AirDrop in China had arrived with the release of the iOS 16.1.1 update. After the update, iOS would revert AirDrop’s privacy settings back to “Contacts Only” after just 10 minutes even if “Everyone” was previously selected. (A user would have to manually select the “Everyone” setting — it was not the default.)</p>

<p class="translated">The change rolled out shortly after major media publications, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214065726/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/business/xi-jinping-protests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including The New York Times</a>, had reported how Chinese protestors were using AirDrop to send messages denouncing China’s President Xi Jinping as well as to share information about protests and instructions on how to download VPNs to bypass the country’s censors.</p>
<p class="translated">Apple, whose ties to China run deep — it’s both a key customer base and a manufacturing base — was called out by some as being complicit in aiding the Communist Party. Others, however, had argued that leaving the feature open to “Everyone” indefinitely had always been a security and privacy risk — and one that should have never been permitted in the first place.</p>
<p class="translated">Another news story illustrates the latter problem, in fact — a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214065726/https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/southwest-airlines-nude-airdrop/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirDropped a naked photograph</a> to others on the plane. The pilot threatened to ground the plane if it didn’t stop.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"/>
<p class="translated">当被问及隔空投送在中国的变化时，该公司曾<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214065726/https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/apple-limits-airdrop-everyone-option-to-10-minutes-in-china/">表示</a>计划在“未来一年”将该功能带给全球用户事实证明，它已经在这么做了。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果今天表示，iOS 16.2 的发布将更新隔空投送，在 10 分钟后将设置恢复为“仅联系人”，以防止不想要的接收内容的请求。该更新今天发布到测试版，并将在不久的将来推广到所有支持的设备。</p>
<p class="translated"><em>更正一下，12/7/22，美国东部时间下午 4:10:苹果在中国的最初改变是在 iOS 16 中推出的。1.1，不是 iOS 16.1。我们已更新以更正此问题。</em></p>
