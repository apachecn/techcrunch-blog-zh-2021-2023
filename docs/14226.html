<p class="translated">Ram 1500 Revolution BEV 概念并不完全是 Stellantis 品牌计划在 2024 年投入生产的。(该版本将于今年晚些时候上映)。不过，它提供了迄今最清晰的画面，展示了 Ram 对其下一代卡车的计划，以及它打算如何在新生的电动卡车市场上与其他进入者竞争，包括福特 F-150 Lightning 和雪佛兰 Silverado 电动汽车。</p>
<p class="translated">它始于为全尺寸电动汽车设计的车架上车身架构，该架构集成了电池组、车身底部空气动力板和主动扩散器，以改善车辆的空气动力学特性。两个电动驱动模块安装在前轴和后轴上，以提供全轮驱动，后轴转向系统允许驾驶员将后轮旋转 15 度。</p>
<p class="translated">Ram 没有透露一些重要的电动车规格，如范围和电池组大小；预计将于本季度晚些时候发布。该品牌确实表示，Ram 1500 Revolution BEV 概念车可以在大约 10 分钟内增加 100 英里的里程，800 伏直流快速充电高达 350 千瓦。当然，这意味着量产版将拥有 800 伏的电力架构，可以快速充电。</p>
<p class="translated">这家汽车制造商确实在 Ram 1500 革命中加入了许多功能、技术和新的设计语言。这是最突出的。</p>

<p class="translated">在 Ram Revolution 中有各种有趣的外观设计选择，例如新的“脸”,包括更现代的徽章和动画 LED 音叉大灯设计。</p>
<p class="translated">也许最显著的设计特点是没有 B 柱，这使得一个大轿车风格的门打开。这一设计决定使得宽敞的内部空间看起来更加宽敞。车厢实际上比 Ram 的同等气体动力卡车长 4 英寸。沙龙风格的门很好地诠释了这一理念。</p>
