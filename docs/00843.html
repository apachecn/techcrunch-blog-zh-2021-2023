<p class="translated">早在十月份，丰田首次为日本市场展示了 bZ4X <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230227185253/https://pressroom.toyota.com/all-electric-bz4x-production-model-announced-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">的量产版。虽然美国版本基本相同，除了右舵驾驶，范围数字是新的。这仍然是丰田的内部估计，而不是预计将在接近生产日期时宣布的 EPA 官方估计。250 英里的续航里程适用于 bZ4X 的 XLE 前轮驱动车型。全轮驱动版本的范围尚未公布。</a></p>
<p class="translated">这款全电动汽车是丰田降低碳排放的整体策略的一部分——尽管该行业已经转向以电池为中心的方法，但丰田仍坚持这一立场。在本周的一次活动中，丰田高管重申了该公司的战略，即提供一系列轻度混合动力车、插电式混合动力车、电池电动车和氢燃料电池车。</p>

<p class="translated">包括通用汽车在内的其他汽车制造商已经承诺在未来完全转向电池电动汽车；丰田没有让步。该公司表示，计划到 2025 年在全球范围内提供约 70 款电动车型。其中，将有 15 辆电池电动汽车，包括 7 辆 bZ，意为“超越零”，品牌。</p>
<p class="translated">到 2020 年，丰田估计其每年销售的 1000 万辆汽车中有 200 万辆将是电池电动汽车。另外 200 万人将拥有内燃机。剩余的 800 万辆汽车，或其产品组合的 80%将是混合动力车、插电式混合动力车和氢燃料电池车。</p>
