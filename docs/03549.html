<p class="translated">就像 Gmail 的收件箱一样，短波本质上是一个以 Gmail 为中心的电子邮件客户端，你可以在两者之间轻松切换。但也远不止如此。更应该把它想象成 2022 年的收件箱。</p>
<p class="translated">正如 Lee 告诉我的，这个团队从 Inbox 中获得了两个重要的灵感。“一个想法是，你应该分组处理你的电子邮件，”他说，指的是收件箱按主题捆绑电子邮件的能力。“随着收件箱中电子邮件数量的增长，浏览每一封电子邮件变得不切实际。即使你有所有的键盘快捷键，你的应用程序超级优化，只是扫描所有这些东西就需要很长时间。”举例来说，当你想了解日历通知等自动邮件时，你可能已经在日历中接受了这些邀请，所以只需点击几次就可以将它们标记为已读或暂停，这样可以节省大量时间。</p>

<p class="translated">此外，该团队还建立了短波，其理念是，无论你喜欢与否，你的收件箱都是一个待办事项列表。“你可以给用户工具来管理他们的收件箱，就像待办事项列表一样，或者你可以强迫他们在头脑中管理它，”Lee 解释道。“他们在收件箱中添加了一个文字复选标记，表示‘嘿，你正在将这件事标记为完成’，以及其他待办事项列表类型的功能。我们也做了同样的事情。”</p>

<p class="translated">例如，在短波中，你可以将电子邮件钉在收件箱的顶部。对我来说，这是一种比使用 Gmail 的星号功能更好的处理邮件的方式，但这可能只是个人偏好(我经常用星号标记电子邮件，然后就再也不回它们了)。您还可以根据需要对收件箱中的邮件重新排序，或者将它们整理成您自己的自定义包。</p>
<p class="translated">正如你对现代电子邮件客户端的期望，它还具有暂停邮件的功能。</p>
<p class="translated">除了收件箱体验，该团队还实现了 Slack 等现代聊天客户端的功能。例如，你可以用 gif 和表情符号来回应，短波的特点是松弛的反应。除了其他旨在使群体对话更容易的功能，尤其是在商业环境中，还有用于群体对话和常见@提及的渠道。</p>
<p class="translated">当对话中的每个人都在短波上时，你也会收到打字通知，你可以看到其他人是否在线。</p>

<p class="translated">我已经测试短波几天了，它确实让我想起了 Inbox 的早期(尽管与 iOS 应用不同，Android 应用仍然有点粗糙，团队也意识到了这一点)。</p>
<p class="translated">正如 Lee 告诉我的，该团队主要针对商业用户。虽然任何人都可以免费使用这项服务，但它使用的是一种类似 Slack 的货币化模式，如果用户想在这项服务中拥有超过 90 天的电子邮件历史记录，就必须付费。</p>

<p class="translated">短波今天还宣布，它已经筹集了 900 万美元的 A 轮融资，实际上它早在 2020 年 4 月就关闭了，就在团队开始开发产品之后。本轮由<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315101310/https://www.usv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> USV </a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315101310/https://lsvp.com/">光速</a>领衔。联合创始人也投资了这一轮，还有 Flybridge Capital 和 Afore Capital，以及一些天使，包括 Immad Akhund(水星公司首席执行官)，Peter Reinhardt 和 Ilya Volodarsky(Segment 的创始人)和 Oliver Cameron(Voyage 的创始人)。</p>
