<p class="translated">蓝色商务并不完全出人意料。11 月，记者 Casey Newton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322201636/https://www.platformer.news/p/elon-goes-hardcore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">获得了</a>份 Twitter 内部文件，显示这家社交网络计划引入其订阅计划的商业层，让公司为其员工购买验证徽章，并将新徽章放在他们的个人资料上。在模型中，来自工人的推文在他们的名字旁边包括额外的徽章，这样他们的状态在时间线中就可以立即被注意到。</p>
<p class="translated">不久之后，应用工程师简·满春·王<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322201636/https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1596221635052257280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">发现</a>有证据表明，订阅 Blue for Business 的 Twitter 个人资料可能会得到方形的个人资料照片。</p>
<p class="translated">没有任何工人徽章购买功能或独特形状的个人资料照片的迹象，但 TechCrunch 今天下午发现了几个带有金色复选标记的企业和媒体出版商账户——不要与即将出现的政府和“多边账户”的灰色标记混淆 Twitter 产品管理总监埃丝特·克劳福德(Esther Crawford)周末表示，期待 it；她解释说，在 Blue for Business“通过一个新的流程”向更多公司开放之前，“以前与 Twitter 有关系的”企业将收到金色复选标记。</p>
