<p class="translated">Taur 于 2019 年登场，为其优质、时尚的白色电动滑板车发起了一场预购活动，该滑板车配有一个脚踏板，让乘客在骑行时面向前方，还有几个大轮胎。该计划将在伦敦推出，但英国仍未能使私人拥有的电动滑板车合法化。</p>
<p class="translated">相反，Taur 从 Trucks VC 筹集了 175 万美元后，将在洛杉矶推出，Trucks VC 是旧金山一家专注于未来交通的风险投资公司。虽然说电动滑板车市场已经成熟还为时过早，但毫无疑问，一家新公司进入这个行业已经足够引人注目，如果不是潜在的令人兴奋的话。</p>
<p class="translated">“当我们开始的时候，我想分享真的很流行，我们做出了自信、勇敢和愚蠢的决定，事实上，我们认为这将成为所有权，”布朗告诉 TechCrunch。“因此，我们正在抓住拥抱这些车辆的市场机会，我们认为洛杉矶是一个很好的地方，不仅仅是从产品的角度来看，而且因为我们认为品牌是我们工作的一个重要部分。我们将改变正常人眼中的滑板车。如果我们能做到这一点，我们就完成了我们的工作。”</p>
<p class="translated">换句话说，Taur 希望创造一种文化转变，不再将滑板车视为小众或“二等公民活动”，而是视为理想的交通方式。布朗说，大多数踏板车公司没有多少个性，他们当然也没有为文化做多少贡献。</p>
<p class="translated">“一直以来，我们都是让它尽可能便宜，尽可能多卖，”他说。“我们被这个机会所吸引，推出真正处于前沿的产品，并成为人们参考的产品。”</p>
<p class="translated">Unagi 滑板车被称为滑板车中的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230106101233/https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"> iPhone。</a>该品牌最近推出的下一代产品<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230106101233/https://unagiscooters.com/uk/articles/more_details_about_model_eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Model Eleven</a>是一款智能滑板车，具有先进的骑手辅助功能，如物体检测和警告，以及内置扬声器等。这款车的价格约为 2860 美元，其标准型号 One 的价格约为 990 美元。</p>
<p class="translated">虽然 Unagi 已经挖掘了像伊基·波普这样有影响力的名人来提升其滑板车的酷元素，但布朗认为该公司还没有将外形因素推向其极限。他希望 Taur 从设计角度打造一款外观性感、定价高端(1495 美元)的深思熟虑的滑板车的战略，将有助于实现鼓励所有权所必需的文化转变。</p>

<p class="translated">这一策略的最前沿显然是面向前方的踏板，它允许骑手采取“双滑雪”的骑行姿势，双脚放在两个向下折叠的脚平台上。布朗说，这给骑车人提供了一个平等的道路视野，他们不会像你在其他滑板车上那样半侧半向前站立。他补充说，这也有助于稳定。</p>
<p class="translated">布朗说:“如果你想当你在滑雪时，你可以调整你每只脚的重量，这样除了车把之外，还可以驾驶车辆。”“这有点不同的感觉。我遇到过很多这样的情况，有些人通常非常坚定地说，“不，我喜欢现在的样子，”然后他们尝试了一下，然后说，“好吧，我现在真的明白了。”"</p>

<p class="translated">Taur 的踏板车有非常大的大陆轮胎，比大多数电动踏板车大 50%。它还配备了三个灯-前灯是一个环绕式灯，不仅为驾驶者提供了良好的视野，还允许其他道路使用者从驾驶者的侧面和后面看到灯光。还有一个专用的刹车灯，以及一个投射灯在后面，向上照射到骑手，使他们完全可见。为了方便旅行和存放，这款滑板车还可以很好地折叠起来。</p>
<p class="translated">布朗说，目前它只有白色，但这既是一种审美选择，也是一种功能选择。他补充说，白色滑板车不仅在市场上的黑色和银色滑板车中脱颖而出，而且也更容易被其他道路使用者看到。</p>
<p class="translated">布朗说，市场上有太多的滑板车无法被一般的自行车商店接受，而且客户服务渠道也很差。Taur 的踏板车是模块化设计的，这意味着它由五个模块组成，这些模块可以互换，以便于维护。</p>
<p class="translated">“‘为所有权而建’从一开始就存在，”布朗说。“你可以在五分钟内换好轮胎，如果你没有轮胎撬杆，你可以用勺子。当你是这些车辆的用户，并且你在设计它们时，你知道障碍是什么，你知道没人碰到它。”</p>
<p class="translated">Taur 将于今年夏天开始交付其滑板车的预购订单，从 8 月份开始，这家初创公司将专门直接向洛杉矶的消费者销售。这些滑板车将包括 30 天退款保证，外加保修。美国其他地方的顾客可以先交 100 美元押金，以确保在 Taur 的等候名单上获得一席之地。</p>
