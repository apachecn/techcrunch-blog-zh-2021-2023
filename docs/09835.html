<p class="translated">像他们的前辈一样，他们非常舒适。AirPods Pro 是少数几个我可以连续几个小时舒适地戴在耳朵上的耳机之一。添加额外的小小费是一个很好的接触，以及，扩大了产品线，以更广泛的潜在客户群。最大的物理变化是在杆上增加了一个小的触摸条。这至少在某种程度上解决了 AirPods 设计的一个最大缺点:缺少触摸板。</p>
<p class="translated">至少在目前，这种功能是有限的。它主要是用来上下调节音频的——不可否认，这是早期版本中缺少的一大功能。这需要一点时间来适应，特别是因为垫平贴着你的脸。然而，它的反应非常灵敏。</p>

<p class="translated">苹果公司表示，主动降噪比原来的 pro 要好 2 倍。这是一个很难量化的事情，尽管我确实注意到在苹果动手的 scrum 这种极其不和谐的环境中进行测试有很大的改进。音频听起来也很棒，尽管该公司最近选择专注于空间而不是高清音频，这不是我会做的选择。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果牺牲了外壳的极端简约性，增加了一个用于拴系产品的挂绳连接器和一个三孔扬声器。后者是为<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230210172540/https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/07/the-new-airpods-pro-case-has-a-built-in-speaker-perfect-for-the-find-my-app/">查找我的功能</a>设计的，当产品丢失时会发出啁啾声——就像该公司对 AirPods 本身所做的一样。哦，和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230210172540/https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/07/apple-unveils-the-iphone-14-and-iphone-14-plus/">的 iPhone 14 </a>一样，闪电接口很不幸，将会持续到明年。</p>

<p class="translated">我预计很快会有一个审查单位，所以期待更彻底的东西。目前，我很高兴地说，它们是非常好的 AirPods Pro Gen 1 的一个很好的升级，但如果你目前的一对仍然工作正常，就不值得花 249 美元升级。</p>
